## Add Auto-categorization Rule

We offer two methods of Auto Categorizations. 
- [One] Vendor match auto categorization where we exact match the vendor name. These rules are auto created when you are categorization your transactions a modal appears to ask to apply this category in the future if you 'yes' it creates the rule and if you skip, it does not create the rule but do apply the category on that one time. You can also review existing rules or create new by 'Add items' > Auto-Categorization rule or [Direct link](https://bookeeping.ai/en/account/:account/dashboard/transactions/categorization-memory)
- [Two] Note match auto categorization where we find your added keyword in trnsaction text and if match then we apply the choosen categry, ideal for PayPal, Zelle, Venmo type merchants who appear to have same merchant name but payment could be made to different parties and purposes.
- To create a new auto categorization rule just Click on Create Memory, select the type of rule 'Note based' or 'CounterParty'
- Select the countryparty or keyword to find in the note. Then select the category you want Paula to apply to on match. Save the rule.
