(This is an automated system). Can you please share with me what activity you were doing at the time it happened? Did you comment too much in a row or message too much? There are several reasons why Facebook can suspend a user's account.
Please increase your visibility on Reddit, Twitter and LinkedIn. There are no such problems at all, do as much as you like including commenting.

You currently cannot select a particular country you want to monitor. These are the only possibilities;
- For Facebook monitoring, you can ensure you are monitoring groups that have more members from your country of interest
- For LinkedIn monitoring, if most of your connections are from a particular country, then a larger population of your leads will be from that country

- For Twitter monitoring otherwise known as X, you can choose to monitor "Global" which does a general search or "near me" which monitors accounts around your country of settlement
- For Nextdoor monitoring, it uses your normal Nextdoor location settings to tailor leads
- WhatsApp groups monitoring only monitors groups you have selected to monitor
